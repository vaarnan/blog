* [2020-08-30 Sun] Lockdown Ruminations

2020 quietly dwindles away.

It started in the recesses of dark London flats punctuated by lonely lockdown chats. Life slowly trickles back to "normal", our memory of normalcy but a faint recollection.

An exquisite dinner party with exquisite company led me to a conversation of gratitude for things done and a storage bog for the things not (yet) done.

Here they are as I recall them.
