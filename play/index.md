## Croatia - Becoming a "proper diver"

![](https://vaarnan.com/img/diving_3.jpeg) *Cliff jumping spot in Dubrovnik, Croatia*

I had signed up for a diving conservation trip with Blue Ventures, in Timor Leste (or East Timor pre-2002 rebrand) after being sold on it by a co-worker.

Unfortunately, they wanted Advanced Open Water divers though were willing to relax it to Open Water for me. A Scuba diver certification would apparently not work with their insurance and they couldn't do the OW course while I was on the trip.

I was forlorn on what to do and then booked an impromptu trip for the next weekend to Dubrovnik Croatia, one of the nearest "warm" places to dive in Europe and get my Open Water certification.

[Rafael Franco](https://www.facebook.com/Setentaenove) was the beast instructor who got me through this course. After a false start when I had to take off my mask in utterly saline water that burned my eyes, I managed to complete my course and become a more careful and professional diver.

Rafael has an eagle eye for safety and equipment that's out of place, and he made sure that I had more than earned my stripes for Open Water.

## Bali - Too ADvanced

I arrived in Bali to begin my diving journey when the Timor Leste conservation trip did not work out as expected (translation: my life's top 10 horror stories).

On the recommendation of Dive Master and friend [Anurag Garodia](https://www.facebook.com/garodia), I went to [Geko Dive (Padang Bai)](https://gekodivebali.com/en/) and asked for a few fun dives. They looked at my dive log and said, you are doing the Advanced Open Water course with us. Gear up!

I looked at them bewildered and said that I had **just** completed the Open Water and I wasn't ready to do an Advanced Course in diving! I'm supposed to be afraid of the ocean, does he not get it 😖

My dive instructor, Bekul, settled for a compromise that if the Deep Dive for the course went well we would consider certification, otherwise just drop it.

We drove over to the Tulamben wreck and I felt reasonable that things could go either way but my dive related fears were at bay. The first time we descended to 25 m, I did panic but Bekul slowed down and gave me space to relax. After a few moments, we continued down and I could finally feel that I had conquered it.

## Utila, Honduras - Getting certified

![](https://vaarnan.com/img/utila_katrina_me.jpeg)

Utila was a meticulously researched dive vacation at the [Utila Dive Center](https://www.utiladivecenter.com/), the most professional center for diving. S had a plan for me - [Scuba Diver](https://www.padi.com/courses/scuba-diver) (12m max) certification with a private instructor.

Enter [Ivana the Unfazed](https://www.facebook.com/Ivana.Inglesina) - I detail my apprehensions to her with the nervousness of a 10-year-old embarrassed about their low reading level. I also explain that I would definitely fail the 10min floating test, perhaps 3min would be alright? Ivana being Ivana, is confident that I would complete the course even after I remind her that I had failed before even starting. She shrugs off doubt with the confidence of someone who has seen it all.

Looking back, I had way less faith in myself than she had in herself.

As soon as I was signed up, she gave me the materials to study and said we would meet the next morning. We returned for dinner and I began studying in earnest - right through dinner and several hours prior to bed.

When I turned up the next morning and met Ivana, I expected to start the dive or theory part of the course. She told me we were going to get the floating requirement "out of the way". "WHAT?" "Let's go" she said and I was stunned, my demons were about to be exposed.

We went to a barge out in the open ocean and Ivana assured me, "the water is so salty, that it doesn't want you. All you have to do is lie back and you won't be able to sink." Words, just floating words to me at the time.

I jumped into the water and splashed about until I could hang onto a ledge with one hand and a line with the other. She didn't get in probably to prevent me from clawing on and pulling the two of us into the water. She told me to lie back, and let the rope go while she started the timer. Thereafter, she kept talking non-stop for the next 10 minutes reassuring me that she was there though I could barely see or hear her while lying on my back.

She understood the psychological importance of making me feel that she was there and it was the most encouraging speech for 10 minutes for simply floating on the water. I would pull my ears out of the water from time to time and hear her voice, tense up a bit and feel like I'm sinking before settling my head back into the water. In the first attempt at floating, we had done it. The single diving requirement that had plagued me for 1 year was now under my belt and I would never have to prove it again.

Then I met my instructor for the course, [Katrina](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100000323394503) and she was her own force of nature. Her job was to get me through the training for the next few days and the most important moment was the first time we entered the water with the dive gear.

I started breathing in the shallow and when I put my head in, all my fears returned and I popped it back up. I started to hyper-ventilate again and told Kat that I wanted to step out of the water. Just for a short while and then we could start again. She held on to me with a reassuring hand and said, "I don't think that's a good idea. Listen to me, I have over 10,000 dives and you can trust me that we should go back down. Trust me." That was an instant ton of credibility she earned in a few words and I kept repeating 10,000 dives in my head and we went back down.

I started breathing shallow and then slowly, started to get better and relax.

The course was on.

When I met S at the end of the day, I was grinning from ear to ear. In the same day, I had completed the floatation test and my first confined drill dive. I think she found it hard to believe as well 🥲

My over-ambitious flaw kicked in and I began to insist that I complete the full Open Water course instead of **just** the Scuba diver. Thankfully, in my parent-teacher meeting between S and my instructors, it was decided that I would only complete the Scuba diver course for the moment and do a series of fun dives after before doing an upgrade to Open Water.

I have learned over time that I don't have to question S's judgement about such things, just blindly follow. She has my best interests at heart and knows my limits better than myself.

Towards the end of the course, Kat started calling me a "water-baby" for how well I had taken to diving and this build my confidence tremendously. I cannot thank her enough for that and how I still think about it when underwater.

[Her note](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2022433711110722&id=100000323394503),

> In the last 2 days I have been humbled by the huge spirit and fortitude of one of my new Scuba Divers. Vaarnan you helped me to learn a huge amount about inner strength and facing down challenges so Thank you to you!
>
> I watched you overcome your fears with grace, quiet application and targeted questions.

## Touchdown Maldives

![](https://vaarnan.com/img/diving_2.jpeg)

The setup for my PADI Open Water course was far from ideal.

A rare overcast day in the Maldives, I was paired with an instructor with language and empathy issues. The ocean was choppy and in my first ten minutes in the water, I was already doing a training dive from the shore. As soon as I put my head in the water with the regulator, I felt I could not breathe. My mind was not convinced that this shallow artificial air mask was doing anything and I began hyper-ventilating. Thumb up, gasping for breath, ABORT! I looked to S and said I can't do this, completely destroyed and about to cry. A nervous wreck.

We got back and had a word with the head of the dive centre (FC) and this is where we got really really lucky. FC told me that I should rent a snorkel set and just spend a whole bunch of hours snorkeling. Once I felt comfortable with that, we would take a look at diving again.

This seemed "reasonable" so I picked up the snorkel gear and started using it in the shallow end of the swimming pool trying to breathe with it and then attempting to float. Slowly, after a day of snorkeling, I felt I could venture into the "deep" end of the swimming pool.

This was not enough though.

My deep-rooted psychological fear of the water was greatly amplified as soon as the base of my feet touched the ocean. Beach vacations were not relaxing for me. Period. Any form of current in the water signaled me to fear for my life, a feeling that the water will suck me into it and I will experience a painful separation of life force and body.

Shallow snorkeling continued consistently though and after half a day, I felt comfortable venturing into the deeper end for about 20 seconds at a time before I ventured back. I would always get up and try to stand in the water up to chest-deep to ensure zero chance of drowning.

The house reef helped an enormous amount since I could focus my mental faculties on something other than breathing. Whenever I started to think about breathing, I would flail my arms about trying to calm down. Not a good strategy to calm down.

On the third day, I finally felt confident and ready to give diving another try.

Meanwhile, S regaled me with stories of her dives and applauded my small victories throughout the day. She was a pillar of support like no other, without S there would be no diving.

Things went different this time. I had Ali, a local dive instructor who was phenomenal ❤

He was well aware of my apprehensions. He started me with taking a few breaths in waist-deep water, and then popping my head out. After we repeated that a couple of times, he said that we would try to stay down.

I was anxious AF and as soon as we submerged, the muted sounds started driving me crazy. Without much external stimulus, my brain was on hyper-drive screaming, "What the fuck, you can't breath.".

Then Ali did something spectacular and burned a memory I will never forget - he picked up a tiny shell and started playing with it underwater, slowly passing it over to me. This was genius - I was instantly distracted from my thoughts and focusing on this tiny shell.

Slowly, he started pointing out tiny fish and some of our local reef shark.

Sensing I was comfortable, we next sat on the ocean bed and I showed him the basic drills - mask flooding and regulator recovery - to make sure I can do this without panicking. I was ready for this part because I had practiced these drills with my snorkel, and we then started going deeper into the water.

I had learned to breathe.

I was keen to continue the course but S's (infinite) wisdom was that we should do the course another time and I should simply have fun with discover scuba dives for the moment. There was no need for me to push myself through the intensive training where they will put me through excruciating but essential drills like taking off my mask, removing my weight belt, cutting off my oxygen. The certification experience was very different from a fun dive and there was no need for me to do this right now.

The Bandos crew is truly 5 star and bat-shit crazy. They saw my discover scuba shore dives and asserted that I was ready to dive in the open ocean from the boat. I had a lot of trust in Ali by this point and knew that he would take care of it so I was onboard.

The dives were magnificent, out-of-this-world wtf experiences - Sting Ray city where we lay down on the sand bed and were engulfed by tens of Sting Ray passing us by. I was hooked, I **needed** to dive.

Ali brought me inches from three Medusa-like Giant Morey Eel in Tuna Factory though I was so comfortable with him by then that I didn't even flinch.

The vacation ended on high notes that made it the best vacation I had ever had.

## The seed

![](https://vaarnan.com/img/diving_1.jpeg)

**Water is fear, fear is water.**

I am in the university swimming pool with my friend.

My breathing heavy, I cannot speak. **We are in waist-deep water**. Death feels close, an easy escape. **I am supposed to swim to the end**. I am hyper-ventilating. **My friend reassures me**. My most vulnerable, my most weak.

"We are a couple that goes on diving vacations, so you need to be certified", the unwavering relationship law dictated in a vacation "planning" session.

S describes diving as a surreal activity where you enter an entirely different world; a world where perception is completely altered. You are not in space, but you could be. You are not flying, but you could be. You are not high, but you could be. The first time you come out of the water, there is a subtle shift in the way you think about life, you have experienced something truly beautiful.

S is the Mark Antony of Antonys', a master orator. Rapture and enamor her audience she will. Lead them on and then pull back, ignite them with a thirst that begs for more. I am but a weak fearful mortal.

Hell-yeah I am hooked to give this diving thing a try. I dig up requirements for a certification because S assures me that she is not a great swimmer anyway, so you don't need to swim to dive.

That's when the most dreaded dive requirement that would haunt me for over a year, hits me - "be able to float on the water without aids for 10 minutes".

I look at that and know immediately that it is **impossible** for me to do.

Of course, we go back and forth for weeks and finally settle on going to the Maldives. Suddenly, we have a hotel with a 5-star PADI resort booked, this is the trip for my Open Water certification course. S executes, everything else flows.

And so begins swimming coaching and getting as much water time as possible. My crippling anxiety reassured by S, she makes me look forward to the trip. I have not felt anxiety like this, facing lifelong fears is not my everyday.

# \[2021-02-22 Thu\] 3 Rules to keep the Sensible Snark alive in any relationship
---
id: 3-rules-to-keep-the-sensible-snark-alive-in-any-relationship
---

You may call it banter, witty wine exchanges or just good ole' snark. The hallmark of secure relationships with both (all?) partners and friends alike, is the ability to absolutely insult the very fabric of the other's existence.

Here are my three rules to keep the venomous verbiage at bay, persevere to preserve riposte revelry (new word!).

1.  Never comment on something the other person is insecure or being vulnerable about. It's mean, just don't.

2.  Sensible snark is not the way to communicate feedback or any other veiled criticism. Conversation is.

3.  Be quick to apologize. 90% of your jokes are bad; **funny in head ⊃ funny when said**.

Have opinions? Maybe I'm interested, prolly not. Hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/vaarnan)

# \[2020-07-09 Thu\] Eulogy for my aunt
---
id: eulogy-for-my-aunt
---

The phone rings on queue. It's the late afternoon, post-lunch call. The bustle of the household settling now, a spare moment to relax and kick your feet back.

I run over to turn on the television and move it to the Sanskaar channel - I know the phone call is from my aunt. I know this because she calls regularly to check-in on how we are doing. I know this because she watches Aastha, and Sanskaar and anything that's alternative medicine smacked on yoga smacked on home remedies. My aunt watches this because my aunt is not just my aunt. She is my godmother, grandmother and my Dad's only sister, all wrapped in one endearing package.

My mum lifts the phone and hurries over to the telly giving me a soft smile for anticipating. Today's discussion is a television healer fresh with recommendations that one should devour cloves of garlic everyday to boost immunity. I know this is common knowledge in the new-age super-food era of California medicine where a chia-garlic-kale smoothie is the only way to go. Our late-90s healer is unfortunately too early to worship in California. He gets his fame in the afternoon slot typically set for a hundred million Indian mums so he can't really complain.

My aunt passed away today. I don't know how to articulate how I feel. No one knows really. I got off from a round-robin set of calls between my mum, my siblings, and my distraught and silent father. They were short. Declarative. Not many words exchanged. So much said in those silent sobs and sad-hushed voices.

I think my aunt lived a wonderful life. Never have I heard a mean word said, not a judgemental thought uttered about someone else. Growing up - love, patience and acceptance were all I saw from her. She was adorable in the way that she would softly repeat and insist you do something until your will-power ran down. You didn't really get angry because that feeling would be so misplaced up against her soft, warm demeanour. You just relented, and at the very least, listened.

Of course, she is an Indian aunt and would have loved to see me get married (the one thing we need to do (then have kids of course)). I didn't think much about it - obviously she would be there. I assumed in my static, fixed child world-view that she has been with our family through every up and down we have seen. Every happy moment swiftly reported to her because it made her happy or every sad moment swiftly reported to her because we knew she cared. My eventual wedding just another thing that we do together.

My aunt passed away today. I know now, I won't get to see her when I head back home. I know she won't be at my wedding. I know that she won't impact my life anymore. Anymore than she already has.

Miss you बुआजी

2020 quietly dwindles away.

It started in the recesses of dark London flats punctuated by lonely lockdown chats. Life slowly trickles back to "normal", our memory of normalcy but a faint recollection.

'Nuff drama and talking about the times we live in (unpre…)

An exquisite dinner party with exquisite company led me to a conversation of gratitude for things done and a storage bog for the things not (yet) done.

Here they are as I recall them.

## things I did well

-   connected with my inner ⭕️ **in London**
    -   in no particular order - Sid, Ellie, Sheraz, Adi, Devon, Jade, Gayatri
-   running, so much running
-   yoga
-   times I worked out 7min, push ups, HIIT
-   meditation everyday for 4 months
-   talked more to parents
-   read a lot (not read this much since school)
-   gained a stone, highest weight I've ever had in my life (mostly 💪 I believe)
-   submitted an incubator application
-   built [TSExamples](https://vellvisher.github.io/TSExamples/) and started learning TypeScript
-   built an app of my own outside of work (not done in several years)
-   learned to cook (more)
-   made some 💵 in the market, got better at options trading
-   made this bog

## things I failed (so far 🤷‍️)

-   online courses
-   startup incubator application
-   consistently working on my personal app
-   aerial silk conditioning
-   dance
-   workout consistently
-   weight training
-   keep up with Spanish
-   practice German
-   continue with TypeScript
-   learn to play the piano better
-   talk to Bhaiya/Bhabhi enough
-   finish the 🏠 deal
-   binge less TV/Netflix/streaming (whatever we call moving pictures)
-   taxes

For the first time in my life, I put on a pair of ice skates and ventured into the [Sky Rink Jakarta](http://www.skyrinkjakarta.com/page/open/id/2) to the very apt Taylor Swift song, [I knew you were trouble](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0DfyAIkGw0) in the background.

A couple of falls later, the video below is the best I could manage! I could barely leave the railing if not for Ishaan's lessons.

Courtesy of Siddhant, we got a great timelapse video as well :-)

[![](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fXLTQi7vVs/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9sSwMWCkibM)

Some basic things that were very helpful for me were,

-   Lace the skates very very tightly!
-   Bend the knees slightly for better balance
-   Falling is inevitable
-   Holding the knees with the hands can help prevent some falls
-   Gloves may help prevent too much damage to the hands during falls
-   Goal is to glide on one foot after pushing with the other
-   Look straight and not down, trust the feet to do the work
-   Brake by twisting the legs 90 degrees

# \[2014-07-08 Tue\] Tips for Tirupati

id: tips-for-tirupati

![](https://vaarnan.com/img/tirupati.jpg) *Tirupati Balaji*

If you are crazy enough to want to visit the holy and revered Tirupati temple, here are a couple of tips for NRIs planning to go there. We drove up so the directions may not apply for people planning to walk up the hill.

-   Drive up the hill and look for the **Supatham Gate** which is for NRIs
-   If you have your passport, you can buy a ticket once you have done the security check
-   Ticket price is Rs. 300 (\~\$5)
-   No shorts or scant clothing is allowed
-   Women can only wear Saris or Salwar Suits (with dupattas)
-   Lunch break at the Gate is from 1pm to 2pm
-   Ensure that you have a valid visa to get the NRI privileges
-   The address written on the form should be a foreign address

## Mobile Phones

-   No mobile phones, cameras, electronic gadgets are allowed inside
-   Phones can be deposited after the security check but have to be collected from another counter
-   The phones go to the counter in batches so one might have to wait an hour or two before the delivery counter has received the phone

## Laddus

![](https://vaarnan.com/img/tirupati-laddu.jpg) *Tirupati Laddu*

Each NRI ticket is eligible for 2 Laddus per person though the collection for the laddu is on the first level at the laddu collection centre (not the ground level as some people might lead you to believe!).

Be prepared for long frustrating queues though anyone visiting Tirupati should be steeled for that.
